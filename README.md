# guess-the-number
A simple game to practice coding. Includes basic HTML, CSS, and some JS to respond to user input.
The goal of the game is to guess a random number between 1-100.
Input a number into the text box and click the guess button to submit a guess.
User will be told if the number is too high, too low, or outside of the range of 1-100.
There is an attempts counter under the text box to show how many times the user has submitted a guess.
Attempts counter will not count invalid guesses, such as negative numbers or numbers outisde of 1-100.
Congratulatory message will be dispayed upon guessing the right number.
